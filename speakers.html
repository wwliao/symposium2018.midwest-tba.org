                        <h3>Wen-Hsiung Li, Ph.D.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Distinguished Research Fellow 
                            <br>
                            Academia Sinica
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Wen-Hsiung Li received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics at Brown
                            University in 1972. Next year he joined The University of Texas Health
                            Science Center as an assistant professor in population genetics, and he was
                            appointed as a professor in 1984. Since 1998 he has been the James Watson
                            Chair Professor of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, and he
                            was the Director at the Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica from
                            2008 to 2016. Dr. Li is currently an academician of Academia Sinica,
                            American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and National Academy of Sciences.
                            <br>
                            Before 1979, Dr. Li focused on population genetics and studied genetic
                            differences between populations. In late 1970’s, DNA sequencing
                            technologies were developed and applied to obtain DNA sequencing data. As
                            a pioneer of DNA sequencing evolution, Dr. Li decided to devote himself to
                            studying the evolutionary biology using DNA sequencing data, and he utilized
                            the molecular clock model to analyze and calculate the evolutionary distance
                            between species. Later, Dr. Li’s group investigated the evolution of gene
                            regulation in yeast strains and species, avian evolutionary genetics and
                            genomics, and the transforming C4 genes into the rice genome. In 2003, Dr.
                            Li received the International Balzan Prize for Genetics and Evolution, and he
                            was the third recipient and first Chinese scientist to receive this honor. In
                            2009, he became the first Asian scientist to receive the Mendel Lecture and
                            Medal from the Genetics Society in the UK for his contribution to genetics and
                            evolutionary study.

                        <p>
                            Assistant Professor

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Heng-Chi Lee received his bachelor’s degree in life science program from
                            National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan and his Ph.D. in genetics and
                            development from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
                            2008. He then became a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Craig Mello’s lab at
                            University of Massachusetts Medical School. Currently, he is an assistant
                            professor in the Molecular genetics and cell biology department at Chicago
                            University from 2016.
                            <br>
                            Recently, Dr. Lee’s research interest is understanding how small non-coding
                            RNA regulates gene expression and promotes genome stability. He used C.
                            elegans as a model organism and showed that P-element induced wimpy
                            testis (PIWI) protein binds PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), and the piRNA
                            complex played critical roles in silencing foreign nucleic acids such as
                            transposons or viruses to reduce the possibility of gene mutation. He further
                            demonstrated that piRNA is able to silence its targets over multiple
                            generations. His research findings have been published in several prestigious
                            journals including Molecular Cell, Nature and Cell. This year Dr. Lee published
                            an article in Science about how does piRNA distinguish endogenous from
                            foreign nucleic acids. He provided a novel solution to achieve transgene
                            expression (e.g. GFP labeling) in the germline by avoiding piRNA recognition
                            and degradation.

                        <p>
                            Dr. Huang obtained his B.S. in Agricultural Machinery Engineering and M.S.
                            degree in Food Science and Technology at National Taiwan University. After
                            completed Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at University of Cambridge, UK, He
                            moved to Singapore and studied nanomaterials from food packaging at the
                            National University of Singapore. In 2016, Dr. Huang joined Purdue University as
                            an assistant professor. His research interest includes the studying of food life
                            cycle assessment and methodologies to enhance the sustainability of food
                            processing. He demonstrated that the nanocomposite food-packaging film can
                            decrease oxygen permeability and reduce the oxidation of ascorbic acid and
                            lycopene in tomato paste. Recently he showed that LED light exposure can
                            induce the maturation and ripening of bananas; furthermore, the accumulations
                            of nutrient including ascorbic acid, phenols, and sugars in banana fruit were
                            increased as well.

                            Dr. Stanley Huang obtained his bachelor degree in
                            Chemistry, and master degree in Microbiology from Chung-
                            Yuan Christian University and Chang Gung University, Taiwan
                            respectively. In 2010, Stanley received his Ph.D. degree in
                            Molecular & Cellular Biology from Imperial College London,
                            UK; then joined the laboratory of Professor Edward Pearce as
                            an American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellow at the
                            Department of Pathology & Immunology at Washington
                            University School of Medicine, where he worked to understand
                            how the cytokine signaling and metabolic reprogramming
                            dictate immunological fate of macrophages in infection and the
                            tumor microenvironment. In late 2015, he joined the laboratory
                            of Professor Marco Colonna at the Department of Pathology and Immunology at
                            Washington University School of Medicine. There, he investigated the regulation between
                            cell activation and metabolic network of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in the
                            pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stanley is now an Assistant Professor
                            in the Department of Pathology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine,
                            his lab is aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity that control
                            inflammatory states, with a particular focus on elucidating how different cellular signaling
                            and metabolic pathways are rewired to fine-tune immune cell activation and function in
                            response to inflammatory diseases and cancer (<a href="https://stanhuang-lab.com" target="_blank">https://stanhuang-lab.com</a>).
